This is a website designed with thoughts of the pandemic.

In the onslaught of a sudden widespread pandemic, we are now terrified of letting unknown people into our homes. However, what will become of us if we need repairs or assistance in our homes? What then?

That's where HomeAid comes in. We plan to provide a platform for everyone to be able to hire help they need for their homes. Users would be able to book other users that provide the services they need. The users that they want to hire would have their contact information, location, ratings, job categories offered, vaccinations, and last covid test shown.
